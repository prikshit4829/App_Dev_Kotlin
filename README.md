Problem Statement:

different club use different social media platform to notify the students about their events which is a very cumbersome process for student to check and most of the time the miss the classes and events due to this problem.

Proposed Solution :

This project proposes a “club events ” to keep track of the college club events and provides all the information about it.
the admin can directly upload event poster in firebase app store and it would be displayed in user app.
